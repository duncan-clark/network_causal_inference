Notes on Using the ERNM package:

0) For reproducibility use the forked ERNM package : https://github.com/duncan-clark/ernm/tree/updates_bayesian_causal

1) R v2 -> R v3 has some difficulty with .C in the .onload for lazy loading in zzz.R file. Fixed by changing to .Call - not exactly sure why

2) For "logistic" statistic, does not accept formulas well - need to enter as list e.g. logistic("smoke","sex"), only works with one variable regressed on another variable, intercept needs to allowed
for with the nodeCount statistic.

3) Need to have any random covariates on the RHS of a | in the formula

4) Need to have any logistic regression variables as character vertex variables so that they count as discrete

5) ERNM does not have a summary method? 

6) ERNM logistic function regresses the y variable against and x variable, both must be factors, the first category of the x variables is used,
   so if y is outcome and x is treatment, the regression is on NOT receiving treatment! ERNM logistic neighbor function regresses y variable on number of neighbors that have the x variable, is analogous the the logistic formulation. NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH THIS!  Added logisticNeighborsTopLevel, for a logistic neighbors function that counts the top level as a "1" for the x variable.
